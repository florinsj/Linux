// there are hundred of Linux distributions, but commands remain very similar

Red Hat

Red Hat // simple distribution that introduces Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) // server applications, paid 

Fedora Project  // sponsored by Red Hat, personal desktop version build on enterprise foundation

CentOS  // all the RHEL packages recompiled and given for free 
        // (large compatible with RHEL,integrate newer software)

Scientific Linux    // similar to CentOS (large compatible with RHEL,integrate newer software)
                    // based on Red Hat, scientific computation
                    // used with particle accelerators , including CERN

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUSE

SUSE    // derivated from Slackware
        // similarities to RHEL

SUSE Linux Enterprise   // contains proprietary code, sold as a server
openSUSE                // free version with multiple desktop packages (similar to CentOS and Mint)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debian

Debian  // result of comunity effort, promotes the use of open source software
        // adherence with standards
        // has own package management based on .deb files


Ubuntu  // most popular Debian derived distribution
        // creation of Canonical company (Canonical makes money by providing support)
        // has several variants : desktop, server and various specialized applications
        // provide LTS version - kept up to date 3years-desktop and 5years-server
        // LTS term = long term support


Linux Mint  // was started as fork of Ubuntu Linux
            // relying upon Ubuntu repositories
            // free but some versions with proprietary code 


Raspbian    // used on Raspberry PI
            // based on Debian versions for ARM 
            // official and recomended version is developed by Raspberry PI foundation

Kali Linux  // Debian-derrived Linux distribution 
            // designed for digital forensics and penetration testing
            // mantained and founded by Offensive Security
            // has around 600 penetration-testing tools

KNOPPIX     // Debian-derived OS designed to run directly form CD/DVD or USB flash derived
            // can also be installed on hard drive 
            // free and open source but include also proprietary software
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Android

Android // sponsored by Google, most popular Linux distribution
        // fundamentally different from its counterparts
        // uses Dalvik virtual machine with Linux = robust platform for mobile devices
        // incompatible with desktop Linux distribution (lacks of traditional packages GNU, Xorg,etc)
        // incompatibility = Red Hat,Ubuntu users cannot download software from Google Play
        // incompatibility = terminal Android emulator lacks many of commands of its Linux counterparts
        // to enable Linux commands in Android use BusyBox

    (lacks=lipsuri, counterparts=omologi)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux From Scratch (LFS) 

// more a learning tool than a distribution
// online book and source code step by step instructions for build a cusotom distribution
// users can modify the aspect of the OS and learn how all pieces works together
// good for build and embedded system project
