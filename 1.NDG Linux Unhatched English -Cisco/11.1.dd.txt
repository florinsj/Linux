dd	// copying files or entire partitions at the bit level

Syntax:
dd [OPTIONS] OPERAND
 
	// can be used to clone or delete(wipe) entire disks or partitions
	// can be used to copy raw data to cd or removable devices
	// it can backup and restore MBR
	// it can create a file with specific size filled with binary zeros wich can be used as swap file


Ex : dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/swapes bs=1M count=50

	if	= input file to read from
	of	= outut file to be written
	bs	= block size (default is in bytes but we can use suffixes to specify other units K, M, G, T)
	count	= the number of blocks to be read from the input file

  	// read from zero file (special file containing unlimited number of zeros) 50 blocks (block size=1megabyte) and output to swapes file



 !! no bs or count needs when copying over entire devices (ex: clone one hdd to another hdd)

Ex: dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb 	// copy entire sda to sdb
